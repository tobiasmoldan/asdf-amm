[Ammonite](https://ammonite.io/) plugin for the [asdf version manager](https://asdf-vm.com).

</div>

## Why use this?

The official instructions for installing Ammonite involve downloading the executable
for your desired version into a folder like `/usr/local/bin`, but this means you can
only have one version of Ammonite accessible at a time, and both installation and
updating are a bit annoying. asdf lets you install multiple versions of tools such
as Ammonite at a time, and you can switch between them automatically, in case you
need different Ammonite versions in different projects.
